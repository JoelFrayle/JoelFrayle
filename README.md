# Hello, I'm Joel Frayle Moreno! 👋

I am currently pursuing a **Master's degree in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics** at the **University of Milan** and the **Politecnico di Milano**. Before that, I graduated in **Biomedical Engineering** from the **University of Los Andes (Colombia)**, gaining hands-on lab experience in tissue engineering and biomaterials, along with solid foundations in physiology.

During my undergraduate studies, I became especially fascinated by **mathematical modeling** for biological systems—ranging from **epidemiological models** and **drug release kinetics** to **gut microbiota population dynamics**. This strong emphasis on mathematical frameworks, coupled with my interest in the physiological mechanisms behind them, naturally led me to specialize further in **bioinformatics** and **computational genomics**, with the goal of contributing to **personalized medicine** approaches.

## 🔎 Main Interests

- **Bioinformatics & Genomics**: pipelines for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data (WGS, WES, RNA-seq).  
- **Mathematical Modeling**: epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, and biological system simulations.  
- **Personalized Medicine**: leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and computational tools to tailor healthcare.  
- **Antiaging Research**: identifying genetic markers and interventions geared towards healthier lifespans.  
- **Blockchain in Healthcare**: secure, decentralized systems for patient data ownership (NFTs).  
- **Telemedicine & AI**: expanding quality medical services through remote technologies and smart algorithms.

## 🛠️ Skills

- **Programming**: Python, R, SQL  
- **Biomedical Background**:  
  - Tissue engineering & biomaterials  
  - Physiology and device fundamentals  
  - Mathematical modeling for biological processes  

- **Analytical Foundations**:  
  - Basic machine learning (scikit-learn, statistical methods)  
  - Data preprocessing in Python/R  
  - Introductory knowledge of HPC workflows, Docker, Nextflow, and blockchain frameworks

## 🌱 Future Projects & Collaboration

I’m looking to:

1. **Contribute** to open-source projects in bioinformatics, computational biology, or mathematical modeling of biological systems.  
2. **Explore** blockchain applications for patient data ownership and secure sharing.  
3. **Support** telemedicine solutions powered by AI, particularly in underserved regions.

Though these ideas are at an early stage, I’m eager to **gain practical experience** and collaborate with teams committed to healthcare innovation and personalized medicine.

## ✨ A Thought from Antonio Escohotado

> “The individual is sovereign over his body and mind.”  
> —Antonio Escohotado, *Historia general de las drogas* (1989)

I see this principle as a foundation for **patient autonomy** and a driving force behind **personalized medicine**, recognizing that each person’s unique lifestyle and health goals call for more nuanced, individualized treatment strategies.
