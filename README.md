# Hello, I'm Joel Frayle Moreno! 👋

I am currently pursuing a **Master's degree in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics** at the **University of Milan** and the **Politecnico di Milano**. Before that, I graduated in **Biomedical Engineering** from the **University of Los Andes (Colombia)**, gaining hands-on lab experience in tissue engineering and biomaterials, along with solid foundations in physiology.

During my undergraduate studies, I became especially fascinated by **mathematical modeling** for biological systems—ranging from **epidemiological models** and **drug release kinetics** to **gut microbiota population dynamics**. This strong emphasis on mathematical frameworks, coupled with my interest in the physiological mechanisms behind them, naturally led me to specialize further in **bioinformatics** and **computational genomics**, with the goal of contributing to **personalized medicine** approaches.

## ✨ A Thought from Antonio Escohotado

> “The individual is sovereign over his body and mind.”  
> —Antonio Escohotado, *Historia general de las drogas* (1989)

I see this principle as a foundation for **patient autonomy** and a driving force behind **personalized medicine**, recognizing that each person’s unique lifestyle and health goals call for more nuanced, individualized treatment strategies.
